# EB-JDAT

This repository provides the code for **EB-JDAT** implemented across different Joint Energy Models (JEM) variants. Each folder corresponds to a specific JEM architecture with ready-to-use training and evaluation scripts.

## Environment settings and libraries we used in our experiments

* OS: Ubuntu 20.04
* GPU: RTX 3090
* CUDA: 12.8
* Python: 3.9
* Libraries: see requirements.txt

## Training

To train an EB-JDAT model on any JEM variant:

*Note that JEM is easy to collapse, and so slow,  the learning rate must be set very low to ensure stable training. Thus we recommend to train on faster and more stable JEMs, such as JEM++ and SADAJEM.*

```
./train.sh
```

## Evaluation

All evaluation routines are consolidated in the  *eval.py*  file. After training finishes, evaluate your model by running, including clf_test, PGD, AA, gen, FID and so on:

```
./eval.sh
```
